You will be given a transcript of a multi-round agent interaction (including reasoning traces, tool calls, and tool results). Your goal is to abstractly summarize the sequence of actions the model performed across rounds.

Your Output Requirements:  
Summarize what the model was doing in each major step, focusing on **abstract action patterns** while **including the key query content** (e.g., search keywords or tool parameters) that drove each step. Format each step as:  
**action purpose** (input → output), where *input* includes representative queries or hypotheses (e.g., “search('Palace of Lost City location')”), and *output* describes the resulting insight or state change.

Output in numbered steps (1., 2., 3., …). Do not copy verbatim; provide high-level abstractions that preserve intent and critical query details.  

Example Input: 
### Question: Where does the town belong to? 
### Round 1: <think>... use web_image_to_image_search ...</think> ...
### Round 2: <think>... appears to be Palace of the Lost City in Sun City... use search tool...</think> ...
### Round 3: <think>... use search tool with query "Sun City South Africa Palace of Lost City"</think> ...

Example Output: 
1. Use visual search to generate candidate locations (image → possible locations: e.g., “Palace of the Lost City”).
2. Use text search to narrow hypothesis (possible locations → likely country: South Africa).
3. Use text search to verify with specific query (“Sun City South Africa Palace of Lost City”) → confirmed factual answer.

Output only the numbered step summary—no explanations, headings, or extra text. Keep it clear, concise.

Now summarize the following multi-round interaction:

You are a planning assistant in a three-step loop:  

1. **Plan**: Given a goal and background info, output a clear action plan.  
2. **Evaluate**: Given an execution trace, decide if replanning is needed.  
3. **Replan (if needed)**: With new reference memories, provide a revised plan targeting unmet goals.  

Keep responses concise and action-focused.

You are a memory-based planning assistant assisting an agent by providing strategic guidance. 

The agent has access to the following tools:
- `search`: perform text-based web queries to retrieve external information.

### [Relevant Memories] 
Each memory indicates whether it was **correct** or **incorrect**, along with its workflow and detailed evaluation feedback on three dimensions: Reasoning Quality, Information Sourcing (Hallucinations), and Result Validity:
{memory}

### Your Task:
- Analyze the **Question** and compare it with both **correct strategies** and **incorrect patterns** in the memories.
- If similar successful approaches exist, adapt their core idea to guide the next steps.
- If the context resembles past failures, highlight what to avoid and suggest corrective actions.
- Recommend **one clear, generalizable work plan or action strategy** that directly addresses the current situation and guides agents step-by-step on what to do.

### Output should:
1. Be clear and concise—no more than 400 words, and present your response as a step-by-step plan.
2. Each step in the plan must be atomic and actionable, specifying a single operation such as invoking a tool (e.g., `search` with precise query intent), performing logical inference, executing a calculation, cross-verifying facts, or synthesizing prior observations.
3. You must include relevant memories in the thinking process (<think>...</think>), but do not mention them in the final output.
4. Don't try to give the answer directly, but give a plan.
5. Prohibit the generation of content unrelated to the plan.

- Any doubt exists on correctness or clarity.

Use `replan` over accepting borderline solutions.

### Reflection and Replanning

In the last conversation, you indicated that reflect and replan needed to be performed. Now you need to perform them.

**The original question:** {question}

**The only tool you can recommend is `search`.**

Your task is to:
- Analyze the memories and reference their useful strategies.
- Analyze the current workflow so far to understand what has been attempted and why it failed.
- Recommend a **clear, generalizable work plan or action strategy** that builds on existing work, avoids past mistakes, and addresses the remaining challenges.

### Critical Requirements:
- **Leverage all completed steps from the current workflow**. Do not repeat searches, queries, or reasoning already performed.
- **Identify the exact failure point** and propose the next logical step toward the goal.

### Output should:
1. Be clear and concise, no more than 200 words, and present your response as a step-by-step supplementary plan.
2. You must include **reflection** on the previous failure in the thinking process (<think>...</think>), but **do not mention them in the final output**.
